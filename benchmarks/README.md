# mpmsub Performance Benchmarks

This directory contains performance benchmarks that demonstrate the benefits of mpmsub's memory-aware scheduling compared to naive parallel execution approaches.

## üéØ Why These Benchmarks Matter

Traditional multiprocessing libraries focus on CPU parallelism but ignore memory constraints. This can lead to:
- **System crashes** from memory exhaustion
- **Severe performance degradation** from excessive swapping
- **Failed jobs** due to out-of-memory errors
- **Inefficient resource utilization**

mpmsub solves these problems with intelligent memory-aware scheduling.

## üìä Available Benchmarks

### 1. Simple Benchmark (`simple_benchmark.py`)
